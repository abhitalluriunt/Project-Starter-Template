# HW1: Brainstorming assignment (1.0 pts)

During the next class we will be choosing groups for the initial AI project efforts. You are ultimately responsible for developing the project ideas you will choose among, which makes brainstorming necessary. The instructor will facilitate project selection. Everyone, **individually** , should write a short paragraph or few sentences describing a potential project idea. Ideally you are looking for something that fits within a 6-week timeframe in a class for groups of size 4-5. The point of this is mainly to have everyone, independently, consider ideas so that when we come togetherness's there for project selection we can pick among the best. Note, projects will require at least 4 people to agree to do them, so you may need to "sell" your idea on project selection day - making it even more important to flesh out your idea with a short paragraph of writing. Specifically we are looking for project objective(s), data source (you need to reference this) and cloud computing platform of your choice.

For this assignment, you are to individually submit your project paragraph **in this document in the appropriate area.** Also organize this information for yourself so you are ready to discuss your choices and ideas on the appropriate days in class where groups are chosen. Note: Brainstorming work is to be done **individually**. The goal is to generate ideas and have the best ideas selected. We will choose groups in class on the proper day based on these ideas. Note: students in the class are **required** to utilize at least two of the three options: 1) commercial cloud tools, 2) Jupyter or Google Colab notebooks with python, and 3) mobile/client-side or website integration in the two projects undertaken in this course.


# HW2: Project proposal (4 pts)

The goal of this assignment is to bring your group together and plan for your project effort for maximum impact. Many projects lead to portfolio items and published papers, so be aware of the potential for your efforts not only in learning but demonstrating what you have learned.

**Submit:**

1. Within 1 week after topic selection in class - your group membership **must be reflected on the list in this document (which is currently set to suggestion/comment access).**
2. Link a publicly-accessible PDF of your topic proposal in the project list of this document at the appropriate location. Note, effort on the proposal will benefit composing the final report.

**Selecting your project.** Group selection and topic choice will be facilitated in class, but you are ultimately responsible for selecting an appropriate project, joining a group, indicating your group memberships, and submitting a proposal with all names on the proposal.

**Groups:**** Groups must be 3-5 people - **** no individuals**. All people do not need to be involved in all aspects of the project but all are REQUIRED to participate substantially in the combined project efforts. You are free to change the project plan based on the info available or interests of the group, but you are to clear it with the instructor before you do.

Additionally, as a warning when picking your partners, we will institute a rule that **you can only work with the same person for one project - no overlap between projects!** That is, you can't be in the same group as anyone you were in a prior project group with. The goal of this rule is to mix groups throughout the class, for reasons that will be discussed in class.

**Topic selection:** This is a course about software development in AI. The goal is to introduce you to the wide variety of APIs, frameworks, and resources available. Choose wisely. You are free to change your minds (even after the proposal) but you must discuss it with the instructor if you do. You can do a straightforward project (e.g. predict X with maximum accuracy given data Y) or pursue more exploratory projects.

**Required topic selection:** You are required to use two of the following approaches in the two projects (i.e., the approaches used must be different for the two projects)

1. **Cloud tools:** Running from instances in one of the top three commercial cloud platforms (Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform) and utilizing at least one AI-oriented API on the platform
2. **Jupyter/Colab notebooks:** Using a Jupyter notebook locally with Python with sklearn and/or Tensorflow/Keras (use the Anaconda installation if unsure) and utilizing a cloud-based equivalent as well (Google Colaboratory, Kaggle Kernel, Google Datalab).
3. **Mobile/client-side integration:** Integrating a mobile or client-side web tool for data input AND automated application of a trained model. Android, iOS, web dev stack… Model training preferred, but application of a previously trained model is acceptable.

**Data:** There needs to be an available data set for you to analyze. Ideally larger and more complex data than something in a curated row-column or database table format (though simpler data sets may be better for initial projects if you are unsure of your abilities)

**Learning goal:** What is the goal of unsupervised or supervised learning on this data? Is it possible with the data available?

**Exploratory and Extensible:** Projects should have multiple facets. One concrete prediction objective is good, but there needs to be enough depth to your approach or optional goals that it cannot be done in only a few days.

**Turning in:** Make sure everyone in your team approves of the proposal. Then link a publicly-accessible PDF of your topic proposal in the project list of this document at the appropriate location. Only one person in the group needs to submit.

**Project Name, Participants, and Workflow:**

Give the project a good name, and include emails and roles of participants in as much detail as possible. You are free to work with people doing projects in other classes, but be specific about who will be involved in the project and their level of involvement.

Document how you will work collaboratively on the project. Weekly meetings outside class, when? If using version control software, a mailing list, or a wiki, provide the link so others can potentially help.

**Project Abstract:**

Include 1-3 paragraphs explaining your project. Consider a short "executive summary" that can be used when you post the PDF. This abstract should focus on the goal of the project from a user's perspective rather than the underlying implementation methods you will use.

**Please provide at least one figure/visual demonstration/screenshot with an appropriate caption.**

**Project Design and Milestones:**

List the underlying technologies and design methods in as much detail as possible, e.g. which programming languages, APIs, modules, server-side configurations, and client-side hardware/software you expect to use.

List as many verifiable milestones as possible between now and the completion of the project. Identify incremental features. The goal is to produce a project that will allow incremental development.

Present a high level architecture of the system with modules identified and the data flow that takes place between them.

**Resources and**  **Related Projects:**

Provide links **and human readable short descriptions** (links are not enough) of the resources you will be using including tutorials, code, or people and projects outside the class who will be involved (e.g. is this also part of another class, or from another class). Also, provide a short description emphasizing what you are doing beyond the resources you are starting with. In any case, also provide contrasting detail for at **least two related** tutorials, approaches, or sites accessible online. You don't have to do something new, but aim to be unique if possible. Identify if the related work is commercial vs freely available as well as those that are closed vs. open source.


# HW3: Project Update (2 pts, two parts)

The goal of the project update is to record a short video describing what you have accomplished already and what you plan to do in sufficient detail given the time constraint. An incremental update to any starting tutorials should have been completed. Most importantly, at this stage everyone in your group should have an awareness of how they can specifically contribute, with no significant bottlenecks. There are two parts to turn in for this update, both minor efforts if your project is unfolding well. One for your group to accomplish and one for each of you individually

**A) Record an MP4 video describing your progress aimed at your fellow students (1 pt - per group)**

Your completed project presentations in this class are to be recorded videos with slides and a run of your project code as appropriate. This task is a warm-up in terms of tools you will use. Record a brief 2-4 minute as a status update aimed at your fellow students in the class. Powerpoint enables audio recordings for slides that can be converted automatically into videos. You can also record a zoom session presenting a set of slides. There is no need to see anyone in the video and all videos should have narrations from someone in the group throughout (no using other people's videos, or just showing with text). This is also an opportunity to request very specific help/advice from your classmates. This is one tool people will rely on for their individual consultations (see below).

When finished with your video, place it in the cloud storage of your choice and create a link that is publicly-viewable (again, be sure to check this permission is set). Then update the indicated link location on the project list with that link. Remember to narrate this toward your fellow students rather than the instructor (who is already meeting with most groups weekly anyway). Think about what they might find useful, or provide details that they could give you constructive feedback from.

** B) **

The previous part is to be on a per-group basis, while this part is to be done individually. Based on the linked project proposals and the project update videos each person should be able to have a rough understanding of other projects in the class. Pick one project you would like to learn more about or think you could help out. Each person in your group is expected to pick a

different projects to consult (get to know your classmates!). Your goal is not to evaluate their project, but rather to find out what you can learn from their efforts, or how you can help them. To facilitate this process the complete set of project proposals will be available from the Modules/Projects folder in Canvas.


HW4: Project Report (10 pts)

Your report is to provide a summary of what you have accomplished, without assuming any prior knowledge of your project. This should resemble your proposal in structure, but with your accomplishments rather than plans clearly documented.

**Project title** and **names** of all people involved in the project. Please highlight any substantial effort or help you received.

**Abstract:** 1-3 paragraph brief description of the project. Leave design decisions and details for later.

**Data specification:** If the project was data-driven, describe the data set(s) and specific supervised or unsupervised learning problem(s) that you are attempting to solve. The classic example is of a features x observations matrix, with a predictor column. Clearly list and describe all your features, and the type and number of samples in your data set.

**Design and Milestones:** Provide an overview of the tools and frameworks used. Describe the models used in enough detail that one could reproduce your results without your code given enough time. _ **Provide an updated version of your architecture that you provided in HW2.** _

**Repository / Archive:** Provide a repository link, ideally, or otherwise archived version of your project with documentation appropriate for another person to independently be able to quickly set up your environment. We will refine this step in future project iterations.

**Code: Provide a PDF of all of the code** that has been written by your group, and include it in the report as an appendix. Singly-spaced 10pt font is preferred. Don't include auto-generated code. Use common sense.

**Turning in:** Similar to the proposals and video updates, place it in the cloud storage of your choice and create a link that is publicly-viewable (again, be sure to check this permission is set). Then update the indicated link location on the project list with that link.


# HW5: Project Presentation (10 pts)

Your presentation is a summary of what you have accomplished, motivated by the goals and intended learning in this pursuit, and predicated on informing the students about the tools and techniques you have used - emphasizing software design approaches. Importantly, Your grade will reflect more what you communicate than the style. However, clarity is your interest, if it cannot be understood, then it cannot be graded. Additionally, you can consider your presentations an advertisement to others in case they may want to continue where you left off.

Turn in the following:

1. A conveniently viewable copy of your slides **in PDF form** with a publicly-accessible link next to your group in the appropriate location
2. Next to your program group in this document link to a recorded mp4 demonstrating your project with these slides as a portion of your presentation. **Recorded presentations must be between 4 and 8 minut es.**

**Notes on presentation structure:**

- **Motivation and Delivery** : The reason for your project should be clear from the beginning. In general, aim to communicate. Speak clearly, and emphasize the i mportant points – context, content, and conclusion style. Avoid excessive detail. Motivate everything you say. Speak more to what they would want to know about the workings of your projects, rather than an incoherent laundry list of what you've done.
- **Demonstration** : You should be able to demonstrate your project's result. Functionality can be minimal, but a substantial, coherent portion of what you originally intended should be working. **Clearly demonstrate your running project in some way to receive full credit**
- **Design** : Let everyone know about the structure of your project. How was the data acquired what are the features, the number of observations, and the predictor variable? What models were used? Were there any particularly important design decisions? Give a brief version history if possible. Share any interesting, _relevant anecdotes_ about the design approach while completing your project that others would find helpful.
- **What's next?** People can pick up where you left off. Let them know what they could do with your start from your perspective.
